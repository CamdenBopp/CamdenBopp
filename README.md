# A short bio: who am I?

I have previously studied at West Liberty University.
I am an amateur (ham) radio operator. My callsign is KE8HVH. 
I dabble (but would not consider myself proficient in) python.

I am trying my hand at some HTML over at [this link](https://qsl.net/ke8hvh/).   I eventually plan to migrate my website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) at some point in the future. 
You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CamdenBopp).
