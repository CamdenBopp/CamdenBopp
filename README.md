# A short bio: who am I?

I have previously studied at West Liberty University.
I am an amateur (ham) radio operator. My callsign is KE8HVH. 
I dabble (but would not consider myself proficient in) python.

My personal website has gone through several iterations. First, I was using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX). Then I transitioned to [HTML5up-massively](https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/massively/) (download link availible [here.](https://html5up.net/massively/download) Finally, these days I'm using WordPress with the Pages theme.  

My website has also moved from qsl.net/ke8hvh to ke8hvh.net.
